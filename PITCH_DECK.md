# EcoPredict Pitch Deck  
**Bittensor Subnet Ideathon Submission – February 2026**

### Slide 1 – Title  
**EcoPredict: Decentralized Environmental Forecasting on Bittensor**  
Hyper-local AI predictions for floods, rainfall, pollution, and climate resilience

### Slide 2 – The Problem  
Climate unpredictability is devastating vulnerable regions.  

- Floods, erratic rainfall, and pollution cost **billions** in damages annually  
- Centralized weather services (e.g., national agencies, global apps) fail in underserved areas  
- In the **Niger Delta**: floods routinely ruin ~30% of crops yearly, destroy livelihoods, and increase disaster displacement  
- Data is siloed, outdated, or biased toward urban/rich regions → farmers and communities left blind

### Slide 3 – The Solution  
**EcoPredict** – a Bittensor subnet that creates a decentralized, incentivized marketplace for environmental AI forecasting.  

- Miners run specialized AI models to generate hyper-local predictions  
- Validators score accuracy against real-world outcomes  
- Users (farmers, planners, insurers) query the network and receive reliable, location-specific intelligence  
→ Crowdsourced, competitive, and continuously improving intelligence — no central gatekeeper

### Slide 4 – How It Works  
**End-to-end flow** (simple farmer example from Rivers State):  

1. Farmer queries: “Flood risk for my farm near Buguma, next 7 days?”  
2. Validator broadcasts challenge to miners  
3. Miners compete: pull satellite/IoT/local data → run AI models → submit forecasts  
   → Example output: 180 mm rain, 75% flood probability, “Delay planting”  
4. After event: validators compare predictions to ground truth (oracles/satellite records)  
5. Top miners rewarded with TAO emissions → best models rise, weak ones fade  


### Slide 5 – Incentive Mechanism  
Designed for genuine “Proof of Intelligence” and long-term improvement  

- **80%** of epoch rewards → top miners ranked by prediction accuracy  
- **20%** → validators for honest, timely scoring  
- Open-source model code required → prevents overfitting/cheating, allows collaboration  
- Penalties: low scores → reduced emissions; repeated failure → stake slashing possible  
- User micropayments in TAO → replenish reward pool → self-sustaining economy  

### Slide 6 – Market Rationale  
**Huge, underserved need + perfect Bittensor fit**  

- **Target users**: smallholder farmers, agricultural cooperatives, state disaster agencies, insurers, NGOs  
- **Market size**: Global weather/climate intelligence market > $10B (growing rapidly with climate change)  
- **Regional focus**: Start strong in Nigeria/Africa where centralized forecasts are weakest  
- **Bittensor advantage**: Decentralized incentives drive innovation in a hard, real-world problem domain — attracts non-crypto users and increases TAO demand

### Slide 7 – Competitive Edge  
**Why EcoPredict beats centralized alternatives**  

| Aspect              | Centralized (AccuWeather, IBM, etc.) | EcoPredict (Decentralized)          |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Accuracy in remote areas | Often poor – sparse data             | Crowdsourced local data → better     |
| Bias / single point failure | High – one company controls data     | Resilient – global miners            |
| Innovation speed    | Slow, proprietary                    | Fast – open competition & rewards    |
| Privacy & trust     | Data hoarded                         | Open-source models, verifiable scores|
| Cost for users      | Subscription / ads                   | Micro TAO fees → funds contributors  |

### Slide 8 – Go-To-Market Path  
Phased, realistic rollout  

- **Phase 1 (Q1–Q2 2026)**: Beta launch focused on Nigerian agriculture  
  - Free trials for farmers/cooperatives  
  - Partner with local IoT sensor providers & extension services  
- **Phase 2 (Q3 2026+)**: Global expansion  
  - Integrate into mobile apps, WhatsApp bots, agri platforms  
  - Partnerships: insurers, NGOs, satellite data providers  
- **Monetization**: Small TAO query fees → grows reward pool → attracts more miners → improves accuracy loop

### Slide 9 – Team & Roadmap  
**Solo founder (for now)**  

- Soms – Port Harcourt-based developer passionate about climate tech & decentralized AI  
- **Roadmap**  
  - Q1 2026: Ideathon submission → selection → testnet prototype (with compute credits)  
  - Q2 2026: Mainnet registration → initial miner/validator launch  
  - Q3 2026+: User acquisition, partnerships, model iteration  

Seeking: compute credits, incubation support, early collaborators

### Slide 10 – The Ask & Impact  
**Join the green AI revolution**  

- **Ask from Ideathon**: Prize pool placement ($1K–$5K+ cash) + compute credits + accelerator support  
- **Bigger vision**: Empower millions in climate-vulnerable communities with life-saving, livelihood-protecting forecasts  
- **Impact**: Save crops, reduce disaster losses, build resilience — all powered by decentralized, incentivized intelligence  

**Let’s build EcoPredict together.**
