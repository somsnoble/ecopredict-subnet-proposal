# EcoPredict: Decentralized Environmental Forecasting Subnet on Bittensor

EcoPredict is a Bittensor subnet for hyper-local AI-driven environmental predictions (e.g., floods, pollution, weather in underserved areas like the Niger Delta). It incentivizes miners to compete on accuracy using diverse data sources, with validators scoring against real outcomes.

## Key Innovations
- **Proof of Accurate Intelligence**: Rewards based on verifiable forecast accuracy.
- **Decentralized Data Integration**: Miners use oracles for satellite/IoT data.
- **Use Cases**: Agriculture resilience, disaster prevention in regions like Rivers State, Nigeria.

## Setup
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/somsnoble/ecopredict-subnet-proposal.git`
2. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run Demo: `python demo.py` (or use Docker: `docker run -it ecopredict python demo.py`)

See TESTNET_GUIDE.md for Bittensor testnet integration.
